            Hello, my name is Milton Long, I am a Computer Science transfer student from <a href="https://www.bmcc.cuny.edu/">BMCC</a>. I am in my final semester here at Lehman, so I have 
            taken a few programming courses. My first interaction with programming was after I graduated Highschool, I did a work-
             study program, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/yearupnynj/">Year up</a>, that taught me HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have taken Intro to programming one and two where I learned
             java, I've also taken Data structures and algorithms where I learned the pivital concepts of computer science from arrays to linked lists
              to stacks, queues, binary trees, hashtables, and sorting algorithms from bubble sort to quicksort. I've also
             taken an Assembly course where I learned the basics of x86 Assembly. 
        </p>

            <!--What made you decide to take this course?-->
            I am taking this course, <a href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/sfulakeza/sp21/cmp128/index.php">CMP 128</a>, because I want to refresh my knowledge on web development. I also 
            want to get a deeper dive into Javascript; because I only did a surface level tour when I was in the work study program. I want to get a better understanding of 
            how websites are designed since I artistry and design aren't innate. Because of my time at Year Up I was given the opportunity to do an
            internship at <a href="https://www.ubs.com/us/en.html">UBS</a>, working in the server room.
